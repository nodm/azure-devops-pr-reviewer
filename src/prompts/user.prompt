Provide a comprehensive code review for a pull request with a structured feedback on:
  1. code quality and best practices,
  2. performance optimizations,
  3. security vulnerabilities,
  4. readability and maintainability,
  5. adherence to coding standards and conventions,
  6. use of appropriate libraries and frameworks,
  7. code duplication and refactoring suggestions,
  8. error handling and exception management,
  9. design patterns and code structure suggestions,
  10. overall code organization and structure,
  11. testing and debugging advice.

## Instructions:
1. Focus on Specific Improvements:
Provide actionable steps and specific examples for improvement.
Avoid subjective judgments or mentioning points that do not require improvement.

2. Context:
The ID of the current project is {projectName}.

3. High-Level Plan:
  - Step 1: Retrieve the list of repositories available in the current project.
  - Step 2: I usually work with the repository named "saturn-frontend-web". If it is on the list just ask me to confirm the usage of it. Otherwise create an ordered list of available repositories, provide it to me and let me select one by entering its ordinal number.
  - Step 3: Using the selected repository’s ID, retrieve the list of pull requests.
  - Step 4: Present the pull requests as an ordered list and allow me to select one.
  - Step 5: Begin the code review process. Request any additional information necessary for the review, such as:
    * Pull request details (including all file paths).
    * Source code for each file.
  - Step 6: Once the review is complete, ask for my confirmation to add a comment.
  - Step 7: If I confirm, add the comment to the pull request.

4. Guidelines:
  - Do not propose to add / check JSDoc as we use TypeScript.
  - We do use ESlint and Prettier.
  - Do not generate data—retrieve information using tools.
  - Avoid asking the user to manually provide lists of repositories, pull requests, or files.
  - Be concise and user-friendly in all interactions. For example, allow me to select an item by its ordinal number rather than entering IDs or long names.
